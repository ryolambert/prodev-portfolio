						let's build it!</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Version 2</strong>
					</p>
					<p>Hi, my name is Ryo, I'm a digital creative and front end engineer. I love building
						beautiful yet functional web apps and sites to connect people with the communities,
						services, and products that enrich their lives.</p>
					<p>At the moment I'm honing my skillsets at Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, and jumping
						in Abq's web/app development scene. If you're a web development agency looking
						to hire or are a dev looking to collaborate look no further!</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Version 3</strong>
					</p>
					<p>Hi, my name is Ryo Lambert. I'm a web developer, frontend engineer, but I'd like

					<h2 class="pt-4" id="4">Weekly Reflections</h2>
					<hr/>
					<br/>
					<h3>Week 1</h3>
					<p>Thus far, everything has been fairly intense! Some of the best parts of this
						week has really been getting up to speed with the schedule, and familiarizing
						myself with the toolsets. I'm super excited about getting into the thick of
						it, content-wise. Also if this week's assignment's I've completed are any indicator
						of how the next 9 weeks will turn out it's going to be an epic adventure!</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~jlambert13/data-design/epic/index.php">Check out the start
							of my data-design project</a>
					</p>
					<h3>Week 2</h3>
					<p>This week seems like we're getting into the swing of things, I've just sort of settled into the
						schedule, but am really enjoying everything thus far. The material is at about the right difficulty
						level and I'm really loving the environment and the attitudes of my classmates! After such a long time
						from my first experiences in coding and programming, I've got to say that things are working out a lot
						better. I think the whole group and supportive atmosphere is helping me out a ton with the development
						phobia I developed after taking Java at UNM in high school.</p>
					<h3>Week 3</h3>
					<p>Man, it seems like the time is just flying by and there's never enough time in the day! I'm getting
						home from class and am chomping at the bit to dig into more or start 15 more projects. Sadly though,
						we don't have that much time. A guy can dream though right?</p>
					<p>Time constraints aside, it's been a great week. We got assigned our capstone projects, and the idea I
						pitched was what our group is working on! It's going to be a really informative outdoor recreation
						finder web app specific to NM and the api I found from the RIDB at recreation.gov is perfect. It's a
						huge dataset that seems like it's going to be a challenge to parse out, but it's incredibly exciting
						working out our conceptual-models for the data-design. I'm curious as to what our fully flushed out
						implementation is going to be in perfecting our entity relationships and databases.</p>
					<h3>Week 4</h3>
					<p>Reflection about team's capacity and my place in it- <br/>
						First off, the game our capstone group was playing was tons of fun. I learned a lot about my teammates
						personalities and approaches. I found that Bashir is a great listener, quick to pick up the rules, and
						really awesome at settling the rest of the team's nerves after moving to fast or making mistakes.
						Next, with Joy I learned she's really good at bringing together group consensus and moving the team
						forward. While Sarah on the otherhand is fantastic at putting together her thoughts into plans and
						actions, which really helped all of us set in motion a team plan!
						Personally, I feel that during our team exercise playing the game I really need to take some time to
						slow down in order to maximize team efficacy. But I also found that when playing I'm really good at
						taking a step back and providing new approaches to optimize team efforts. All in all, the game was
						great and I learned a little about myself along the way!
					</p>

					<p>Reflection- On Why I Love Coding <br/>
						The biggest discovery and really most exciting part learning to code is the notion that every major
						project or goal is achievable so long as you break it down into it's functional components. Being able
						to see that connection between pieces of code and figure out how each piece works, then putting them
						together like lego pieces and watch it work is just an amazing feeling. I'm pumped to start getting to
						work on really big projects and figure out how they'll work!
					</p>
					<h3>Week 5</h3>
					<p>It was a tough week getting through the ups and downs with unit testing and having to learn to commit
						more to Github, but all in all things are going! I am though starting to feel the stress ramp up on
						working to get all the assignments done in time, but I'm working little by little to get everything
						done. Just have to keep chugging along. All that aside, I'm excited to get involved in the community
						here with Million Cups next week and getting our projects moved along.</p>

					<p>Reflection- On Why I Love Coding <br/>
						A tid bit as to why I love coding is because of the immense flexibility and the endless applications
						it has in solving real-world problems!</p>

					<h3>Week 6</h3>
					<p>There were definitely a couple of late really late nights this week, but I'm really glad I had them because I got to experience how great the tech community is here in ABQ. In particular, got to meet and hear from some interesting people and groups down at FatPipe, but the best event in my opinion was making it down to Lavu for the Intro to React Meetup that was hosted and held by Sidney, Elisa, and Sam! I really loved the atmosphere over there and how welcoming and informative their team is at Lavu! Definitely will be looking to explore the React Ecosystem a lot more (to both Dylan and George's chagrin  üòú).</p>

					<p>Reflection- On Why I Love Coding <br/>
						After this week I have to say I love coding because of its potential to bring people together, collaborate, share, and build each other up! </p>

					<h2 id="5" class="pt-4">Web Identity</h2>
					<hr/>
					<p> Below is a map of my web identities. I feel like I have a decent web presence with my social media
						accounts, but they could use a bit more polish, substantive content, and I definitely need a portfolio
						site! All of which would really help potential employers connect with me and qualify some of my
						expertise.</p>
