					<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
					<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
					<hr/>
					<p>Name + WHAT + WHY + HOW + Question<br/>
						Hi, my name is Ryo. I build websites, apps, digital art, ui/ux; that help connect people to the
						communities, services,places, and products that enrich life.</p>
					<p>I'm doing this by learning about programming in JS, CSS/HTML, getting involved in the tech community,
						and
						working on demo projects.
						Why wait for the future, let's build it!</p>
					<p><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
					<p>Hi, my name is Ryo, I'm a digital creative and front end engineer. I love building beautiful yet
						functional web apps and sites to connect people with the communities, services, and products that
						enrich
						their lives.</p>
					<p>At the moment I'm honing my skillsets at Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp, and jumping in Abq's web/app
						development scene. If you're a web development agency looking to hire or are a dev looking to
						collaborate
						look no further!</p>
					<p><strong>Version 3</strong></p>
					<p>Hi, my name is Ryo Lambert. I'm a web developer, frontend engineer, but I'd like to think of myself as
						a
						digital nomad or creative... I love building web apps, sites, and digital experiences to connect
						people
						with the communities, services, and products that enrich their lives.</p>

					<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
					<hr/>
					<h3>Week 1</h3>
					<p>Thus far, everything has been fairly intense! Some of the best parts of this week has really been
						getting
						up to speed with the schedule, and familiarizing myself with the toolsets. I'm super excited about
						getting into the thick of it, content-wise. Also if this week's assignment's I've completed are any
						indicator of how the next 9 weeks will turn out it's going to be an epic adventure!</p>
